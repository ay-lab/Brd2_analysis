# <span style="color:green;">Brd2 analysis</span>
Analysis and data from the report titled 'Brd2 is dispensable for genome compartmentalization and replication timing'.

[Visualization](https://ay-lab.github.io/Brd2_analysis/intra_igv_pcQnm.html) of the eigenvectors for Brd2 depletion and control at 100kb resolution.

[Code](https://ay-lab.github.io/Brd2_analysis/Plots.html) for generating the figures in the report.

Raw (jupyter notebook) code available in a [Github Repository](https://github.com/ay-lab/Brd2_analysis). Will need to install R, jupyter notebook and an R kernel to run locally.
